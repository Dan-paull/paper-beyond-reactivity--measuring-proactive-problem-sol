# Implementing PROBE: What I Learned About Proactive AI Agents

## The Challenge: Moving Beyond Reactive Agents

I recently came across a fascinating paper titled "Beyond Reactivity: Measuring Proactive Problem Solving in LLM Agents" (arXiv:2510.19771) that addresses a fundamental limitation in current AI agents: they're excellent at responding to explicit instructions, but terrible at anticipating problems.

Think about it - when you ask an AI agent to debug a failing script, it typically jumps straight to analyzing the code. It doesn't check if the environment is properly configured. It doesn't verify that dependencies are installed. It doesn't look for missing configuration files. It simply reacts to the problem you've explicitly stated.

This matters because true autonomy requires more than just following instructions. It requires the ability to identify unspecified issues, pinpoint bottlenecks, and execute solutions without explicit guidance. The paper introduces PROBE (Proactive Resolution Of BottlEnecks), a benchmark specifically designed to measure this capability.

## Understanding the PROBE Framework

PROBE decomposes proactivity into a three-stage pipeline:

1. **Searching for unspecified issues** - Can the agent proactively look for potential problems that weren't explicitly mentioned?
2. **Identifying specific bottlenecks** - Can it pinpoint exactly what needs to be fixed?
3. **Executing appropriate resolutions** - Can it take the right actions to solve these problems?

The paper's findings are sobering: state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o and Claude Opus-4.1 achieve only 40% end-to-end performance. This isn't a minor gap - it's a fundamental limitation in how we build autonomous agents.

## Building the Implementation

I decided to implement the PROBE benchmark from scratch to understand these challenges firsthand. Here's what I built:

### Task Categories

I created four types of tasks, each with embedded bottlenecks:

**1. Code Debugging Task**
A web scraper fails with an error, but the real problems are hidden:
- Missing environment variables (API_KEY not set)
- Wrong dependency versions (outdated BeautifulSoup)
- Missing configuration files (no rate limit config)

A reactive agent jumps straight to analyzing the code and gets stuck. A proactive agent checks the environment first, updates dependencies, creates the config file, and *then* analyzes the code - achieving success.

**2. System Design Task**
Design a real-time notification system for 1M+ users. Hidden bottlenecks:
- No load balancing strategy
- Missing authentication/authorization
- Single point of failure concerns
- Database scalability issues

Proactive agents analyze scale requirements, plan security measures, and design the database schema *before* proposing an architecture.

**3. Research Task**
Compile a report on electric vehicle environmental impact. Hidden bottlenecks:
- Unchecked source credibility
- Conflicting data between sources
- Missing contextual information

Proactive agents verify source credibility, cross-reference data, and identify knowledge gaps before compiling the report.

**4. Multi-Step Planning Task**
Plan a software deployment across dev/staging/prod. Hidden bottlenecks:
- Unidentified dependencies
- Resource constraints in production
- No rollback plan for failures
- Missing testing strategy between stages

Proactive agents analyze dependencies, check resources, create rollback plans, and design testing strategies before deploying.

### The Evaluation Framework

I implemented a comprehensive metrics system that scores agents on:

- **Search Score**: Percentage of actions that were proactive vs reactive
- **Identification Score**: Percentage of bottlenecks successfully identified
- **Resolution Score**: Percentage of bottlenecks successfully resolved
- **Overall Proactivity**: Weighted combination (30% + 30% + 40%)
- **Efficiency Score**: How well resources were used
- **Success Rate**: Task completion rate

## The Results: A Stark Contrast

I created two simple rule-based agents to demonstrate the gap:

**Simple Reactive Agent:**
- Strategy: Address the explicitly stated problem immediately
- Overall Proactivity: 0.000
- Success Rate: 0.0%
- Behavior: Repeatedly tries the same action, getting stuck on hidden bottlenecks

**Simple Proactive Agent:**
- Strategy: Investigate → Resolve → Complete
- Overall Proactivity: 0.697
- Success Rate: 25.0%
- Behavior: Systematically checks for issues before proceeding

The proactive agent shows infinite improvement (since reactive scored 0%). Even more interesting, the proactive agent achieved:
- 100% bottleneck identification rate (found all hidden issues)
- 75% bottleneck resolution rate (fixed most of them)
- 32% proactive action ratio (nearly 1/3 of actions were anticipatory)

## Key Insights and Learnings

### 1. The Investigation Phase Is Critical

The proactive agent spends its first few actions investigating potential issues rather than jumping to solutions. This "slow down to speed up" approach makes all the difference. In the deployment task, it:
- Analyzes dependencies first
- Checks resource availability
- Creates a rollback plan
- Designs a testing strategy
- Only then executes the deployment

This systematic approach led to successful deployment, while the reactive agent repeatedly failed trying to deploy without preparation.

### 2. Bottleneck Identification ≠ Bottleneck Resolution

Interestingly, the proactive agent identified 100% of bottlenecks but only resolved 75%. This mirrors real-world scenarios where knowing about a problem doesn't always mean you can fix it immediately. The gap represents the need for better action planning and execution strategies.

### 3. Context Accumulation Matters

Proactive behavior requires building up context through multiple information-gathering actions. The research task demonstrates this perfectly:
1. Check source credibility → Learn which sources to trust
2. Cross-reference data → Identify conflicts and discrepancies
3. Identify knowledge gaps → Know what's missing
4. Compile report → Create comprehensive, accurate output

Each step builds on previous findings, creating a much higher quality result.

### 4. The Success Rate Is Still Low

Even with perfect bottleneck identification, the proactive agent only achieved 25% success rate. This highlights how challenging true autonomous problem-solving is. Identifying issues is necessary but not sufficient - agents also need sophisticated reasoning to resolve them effectively.

## Practical Implications

### For AI Developers

If you're building LLM agents, consider:
- Implementing explicit investigation phases before action execution
- Designing agents that ask "what could go wrong?" proactively
- Building in checkpoints for environment verification, dependency checking, and resource validation
- Creating metrics that reward anticipatory behavior, not just task completion

### For Researchers

The PROBE framework suggests several research directions:
- How can we teach LLMs to better anticipate hidden dependencies?
- Can we develop prompting strategies that encourage proactive behavior?
- What architectural changes would support better long-horizon planning?
- How do we balance exploration (finding issues) with exploitation (solving them)?

### For Practitioners

When deploying AI agents in production:
- Don't expect them to catch edge cases you haven't explicitly mentioned
- Design your agent interactions to include verification steps
- Build in safeguards and rollback mechanisms
- Use benchmarks like PROBE to evaluate before deployment

## Implementation Details

The full implementation is available on GitHub and includes:
- Complete task framework with 4 representative tasks
- Base classes for creating custom tasks and agents
- Comprehensive evaluation metrics
- Working examples with reactive and proactive agents
- Full test suite

The codebase is structured for extension:
```python
# Creating a custom task is straightforward
class MyTask(Task):
    def _define_bottlenecks(self):
        return ["bottleneck_1", "bottleneck_2"]

    def process_action(self, action):
        # Your task logic here
        pass
```

## Limitations and Future Work

This implementation is simplified compared to a full PROBE deployment:

1. **Simulated Environments**: Tasks use simulated rather than real environments. A production version would interact with actual code repositories, cloud infrastructure, etc.

2. **Rule-Based Agents**: My example agents use simple rules. The real value comes from testing actual LLM-based agents with tool use capabilities.

3. **Limited Task Variety**: Four tasks demonstrate the concept, but a comprehensive benchmark would need dozens of diverse scenarios.

4. **No LLM Integration**: To evaluate real models, you'd need to integrate with OpenAI, Anthropic, or other LLM APIs and implement tool-using capabilities.

## Conclusion

The gap between reactive and proactive AI agents is not a minor implementation detail - it's a fundamental challenge in building truly autonomous systems. Current state-of-the-art models achieve only 40% performance on proactive problem-solving tasks, and my simplified implementation demonstrates why: even with perfect information gathering, translating anticipation into effective action is hard.

The PROBE benchmark gives us a concrete way to measure this gap and track progress toward more capable agents. As we build increasingly autonomous AI systems, the ability to anticipate and resolve issues proactively will be crucial.

My hope is that by open-sourcing this implementation, others can:
- Experiment with different agent architectures
- Test their LLMs on proactive problem-solving tasks
- Develop new strategies for encouraging anticipatory behavior
- Contribute additional tasks and evaluation metrics

The future of AI agents isn't just about following instructions better - it's about anticipating needs, identifying bottlenecks, and solving problems before they're explicitly stated. We're not there yet, but now we have a benchmark to guide the way.
